A Number Guessing Game

Hello,

This is my submission for the Gaming Making Task for the Aaruush 1st year recruitment.

I have spent the time given learning basic Python from YouTube and using AI to help me fix and finish the code for the project while making sure I understand everything.

The features of the program:

1)Does not take invalid input (anything which is not an integer)

2)Counts attempts

3)Let the user know to guess higher or lower
